A reduced size lightcone has been generated from this primary dataset, which can be used for testing purposes and at 2.8 Gbytes, is small enough for download to personal off-site computers. This can be found at: Luminosity and redshift limited lightcone This lightcone only extends out to a redshift of z<=0.4 and a luminosity cut-off has been applied such that only galaxies with a luminosity L<= 21 are included in the catalogue. File structure The lightcone data is stored in files conforming to the hdf5 file format. Primary dataset Data for each shell derived from a specific Gadget snapshot is stored in a separate file, with a name of the form: galaxy_lightcone.snapxx where xx is the snapshot number ranging from 42 - 63. Each of these files contains 8 datasets, corresponding to each of the 8 octants that comprise the complete spherical volume of the lightcone, with a dataset name of the form: octant_x where x is the octant number in the range 0 - 7 Reduced dataset All the data for the entire reduced dataset is stored in a single dataset ('galaxies') , contained within a single file.
