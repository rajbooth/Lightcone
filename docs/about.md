## Overview
The galaxy lightcone catalogue provides a dataset of over 2 billion galaxies extending out to a redshift of $z \simeq 0.85$, contained in a co-moving cubic volume of $6000 Mpc^3/h^3$.  In addition to the positional co-ordinates of each galaxy, the lightcone dataset also assigns a luminosity value to each galaxy such that the overall luminosity distribution fits a [Schechter function](#luminosity).  This enables the user to apply a magnitude filter to the galaxy dataset to extract only those galaxies that will be visible in an observational galaxy survey for a given instrument sensitivity.
The dataset also holds the redshift space distortion factor associated with each galaxy, derived from its peculiar velocity in the N-body simulation snapshot.  This allows the user to generate positional data in redshift space if desired.
